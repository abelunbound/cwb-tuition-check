# GoodFaith Platform - Authentication TODOs

## Critical Security Tasks Before Production

### 1. User Authentication
- [ ] Implement proper password hashing using bcrypt or Argon2
- [ ] Add password complexity requirements (min length, special chars, numbers)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for login attempts
- [ ] Add account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- [ ] Set up proper session management with secure session tokens
- [ ] Implement password reset functionality with secure tokens
- [ ] Add email verification for new accounts
- [ ] Set up secure cookie handling with HttpOnly and Secure flags

### 2. Session Management
- [ ] Implement proper session timeout (currently hardcoded SESSION_TIMEOUT)
- [ ] Add session invalidation on logout
- [ ] Implement session rotation on privilege escalation
- [ ] Add concurrent session handling
- [ ] Set up session storage in a secure database
- [ ] Add session fingerprinting for additional security

### 3. API Security
- [ ] Implement JWT or similar token-based authentication for API endpoints
- [ ] Set up CORS policies properly
- [ ] Add API rate limiting
- [ ] Implement request signing for sensitive operations
- [ ] Add API versioning
- [ ] Set up proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

### 4. Database Security
- [ ] Move database credentials to environment variables
- [ ] Implement database connection pooling
- [ ] Set up proper database user roles and permissions
- [ ] Add database query parameterization to prevent SQL injection
- [ ] Implement data encryption at rest
- [ ] Set up database backup and recovery procedures

### 5. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- [ ] Implement 2FA using authenticator apps
- [ ] Add backup codes for account recovery
- [ ] Set up SMS/email fallback for 2FA
- [ ] Add 2FA bypass protection
- [ ] Implement remember-device functionality
- [ ] Add audit logging for 2FA events

### 6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- [ ] Define user roles (admin, staff, applicant)
- [ ] Implement role-based permissions
- [ ] Add role hierarchy
- [ ] Set up access control lists (ACLs)
- [ ] Implement attribute-based access control where needed
- [ ] Add audit logging for permission changes

### 7. Security Headers and Configuration
- [ ] Set up proper CSP (Content Security Policy)
- [ ] Add HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- [ ] Configure X-Frame-Options
- [ ] Set up X-Content-Type-Options
- [ ] Add X-XSS-Protection
- [ ] Implement Referrer-Policy
- [ ] Set up secure SSL/TLS configuration

### 8. Audit and Logging
- [ ] Implement comprehensive security logging
- [ ] Set up audit trails for sensitive operations
- [ ] Add automated security alerts
- [ ] Implement log rotation and archival
- [ ] Set up log analysis tools
- [ ] Add monitoring for suspicious activities

### 9. Compliance
- [ ] Ensure GDPR compliance for EU users
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Add privacy policy and terms of service
- [ ] Set up data export functionality
- [ ] Implement right to be forgotten
- [ ] Add consent management

### 10. Testing
- [ ] Perform security penetration testing
- [ ] Add automated security scanning
- [ ] Implement security unit tests
- [ ] Set up continuous security testing
- [ ] Add vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Perform regular security audits

## Current Implementation Issues to Fix
1. Remove hardcoded user credentials in auth.py
2. Fix session management in app.py to use secure session storage
3. Update login form to include CSRF protection
4. Add proper error handling for authentication failures
5. Implement proper password reset flow
6. Fix client-side session storage to use secure alternatives
7. Add rate limiting to login endpoint
8. Update user database schema for better security

## Notes
- Current implementation uses basic session storage
- Password hashing is not implemented
- No rate limiting on login attempts
- Session timeout is hardcoded
- User credentials are stored in plain text
- No 2FA implementation despite UI showing the option
- Role-based access control is not implemented
- No audit logging for security events

## Priority Order
1. Implement secure password hashing
2. Set up proper session management
3. Add rate limiting
4. Implement 2FA
5. Set up RBAC
6. Add security headers
7. Implement audit logging
8. Add compliance features
9. Perform security testing
10. Deploy with monitoring
